git client software:
commands:

Make any folder as local git repo:
-> git init


NOte: First time connect localrepo with remote repo

-> git remote add origin  https://javeed512@bitbucket.org/hdfc-repo-javeed/myrepo.git

Configure local repo with remote by providing user,email,password info only once
for authentication and authorization.
Or
We can just wait till a window pop-up with browser option , where we can login and get authorization.


Add folder/files to local repo
-> git add .

-> git status
Note: green message added/staged , red message not added / unstaged

To save file/folders in localrepo use commit
-> git commit -m "some title message"

-> git push origin master
Note: sometime use --force to push

For,creating new branch
-> git branch branch_name

To switch branch
-> git checkout branch_name

To clone data (as reader not owner) , only first time.
-> git clone https://javeed512@bitbucket.org/hdfc-repo-javeed/myrepo.git 

To pull update files from remote to localrepo
-> git pull   https://javeed512@bitbucket.org/hdfc-repo-javeed/myrepo.git

To merge branches , first switch to that child-branch from there use below command to merge with master branch
-> git checkout branch1  (we are into branch1)

-> git merge branch1 

Note: Now, because of security reasons the owner need to perform pull request  and check what branch are getting merge with what data if everything is fine then pull-request and merge branches.
