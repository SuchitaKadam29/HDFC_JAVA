JDBC Steps.
1.register or load driver class
2. get the DB Connection using url,username,password
3. create any one statement
4. execute query , call executeUpdate() for DML  and executeQuery() for DQL/select.
5. close the DB Connection


Statement:
It is used for static queries , means queries which does not ask for any kind of inputs. 
Ex: select * from dept;
    delete from dept;
Ex: DDL queries

5. SELECT ALL



Statement: For static queries
PreparedStatement: Dynamic queries

CallableStatement: Calling or executing pl/sql procedures in java.


PL/SQL 
Procedure demo:
-----------------------
Create Procedure  Dept_Pro(dno)
BEGIN

INSERT INTO DEPT Values(10,'Development',null);

UPDATE DEPT SET location = 'pune' where dno = 10;

select * from dept;
	

END;

Procedure Dept_Pro created successfully.


Execute:
========

call  Dept_Pro;


Java Callable Statement:
--------------------------

String query = "{call Dept_Pro}"

CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall(query);

		cstmt.execute();
